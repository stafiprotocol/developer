# Get Started

EVM LSD Stack is devoted to help developers building liquid staking project in EVM compatible chains such as Sei, BNB Smart Chain, Polygon etc, and designed to provide a comprehensive set of solutions related to commission fee management, validator set management, and user operations: stake, unstake, withdraw.

## Contracts

Through the contracts provided by StaFi, project parties can create their LSD network contracts. These contracts are not only essential for a LSD project that records all the states of the project, such as: selected validator set, the rate between LST and TargetToken and commission fee etc, but also the dependence of Relay service and LSD dApp.

## LSD Relay Service

After creating the contracts, you'll need to deploy the relay service. The relay service operates off-chain and requires these addresses to work properly.

It provides functionality to generate related key pairs based on account private keys. It triggers the smart contract to handle new era process: delegate, undelegate and update rate etc.

## LSD dApp

Once the LSD contracts created, you can deploy the LSD dApp for users to stake, unstake, withdraw and get the latest information about the project party.
